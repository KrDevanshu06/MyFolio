## 1. Problem Statement

Early detection of forest fires is critical for containment. Satellite latency is often too high, necessitating low-altitude aerial surveillance (drones) processed by efficient edge-compatible models.

## 2. Methodology

We designed a custom **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture optimized for binary classification (Fire / No-Fire).

### 2.1 Data Preprocessing

To reduce false alarms (often caused by sunsets or red foliage), we implemented aggressive augmentation:

* **Color Jittering:** Varying saturation to force the model to learn texture, not just color.
* **Random Rotation:** Ensuring orientation invariance.

### 2.2 Model Architecture

```python
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5), # Prevent overfitting
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

## 3. Performance Metrics

The model was evaluated on a dataset of 10,000+ aerial images.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | > 90% |
| False Alarm Reduction | 30% |
| Inference Time | 45ms |

## 4. Conclusion

By optimizing the batch training process and refining the dataset, we created a model viable for deployment on drone hardware with limited GPU overhead.
