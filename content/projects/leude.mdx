## 1. Introduction

The financial sector requires robust, auditable, and fast decision-making engines. **LEUDE** (Loan Underwriting Engine) was architected to bridge the gap between traditional ledger-based systems and modern AI-driven analytics.

## 2. System Architecture

We adopted a **Microservices** pattern to ensure scalability and separation of concerns.

* **Frontend Portal**: Built with **Next.js** for a reactive, server-rendered dashboard.
* **Backend Service**: Engineered in **Go (Golang)** for high-concurrency request processing.
* **Event Bus**: **Apache Kafka** handles asynchronous communication between the ingestion layer and the processing engine.
* **Storage**:
    * **PostgreSQL**: Transactional data.
    * **Neo4j**: Graph database for mapping applicant relationships and fraud detection.
    * **MinIO**: S3-compatible object storage for document retention.

### 2.1 Docker Orchestration

The entire environment is containerized. Here is a snippet of the composition logic:

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - kafka
      - neo4j
  
  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:latest
    environment:
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092
```

## 3. AI Integration

The underwriting engine doesn't just check credit scores; it uses a Python-based microservice to run predictive risk models on the applicant's transaction graph stored in Neo4j.

## 4. Results

The "Digital Filer" MVP successfully demonstrated the ability to handle complex loan applications with a reduced processing time, validating the microservices approach for this domain.
