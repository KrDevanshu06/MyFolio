## Introduction

During my internship at **Infotact Solutions**, the challenge was to improve user engagement by suggesting relevant content. We chose a **Collaborative Filtering** approach to leverage user-item interaction data.

## Mathematical Framework

We utilized **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** to decompose the user-item interaction matrix $A$ into latent factors.

$$
A \approx U \Sigma V^T
$$

Where:
* $U$: User preferences matrix
* $V^T$: Item attributes matrix
* $\Sigma$: Weights of latent factors

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

For real-time "Similar Item" recommendations, we used KNN with **Cosine Similarity**:

$$
\text{similarity}(A, B) = \frac{A \cdot B}{||A|| \times ||B||}
$$

## Implementation

The pipeline involved cleaning the MovieLens dataset, creating a sparse matrix, and training the models.

```python
from surprise import SVD
from surprise.model_selection import cross_validate

# Algorithm Selection
algo = SVD(n_factors=100, n_epochs=20, lr_all=0.005, reg_all=0.02)

# Training and Evaluation
results = cross_validate(algo, data, measures=['RMSE', 'MAE'], cv=5, verbose=True)
```

## Results

* **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: 0.766 (Lower is better)
* **Precision@10**: 81.02% (High relevance in top 10 results)

## Conclusion

The hybrid approach of using SVD for matrix completion and KNN for localized similarity proved highly effective for this dataset scale.
